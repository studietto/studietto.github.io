<h1>Terms of Services</h1>
<h4>Last Updated: December 01, 2019</h4>

<p>Studietto by Marco Bellinaso, its subsidiaries and affiliates (“<strong>Company</strong>” or “<strong>we</strong>”) welcome you (“<strong>User</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”) to the featured interactive mobile device applications offered by us (“<strong>App (s)</strong>” as further defined below).</p>


<h2>1. Acceptance of the Terms</h2>
<p>The terms of use herein (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern the relationship between you and Studietto regarding your use of the Apps. The collection, use, and disclosure of Users’ information (including personal information) is detailed in the Privacy Policy available at <a href="http://studietto.com/kidsgames-privacy">http://studietto.com/kidsgames-privacy</a> (“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) which you should read and familiarize yourself with.</p>
<p>By installing the Apps on your mobile device, entering into, connecting to, using and/or accessing any of the Apps, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by the Terms, and agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding your use of the Apps and you acknowledge that these Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between the Company and you. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL ANY OF THE APPS, DO NOT ENTER INTO, CONNECT TO, ACCESS OR USE ANY OF THE APPS AND PROMPTLY ERASE ALL OUR APPS FROM YOUR MOBILE DEVICE.</p>
<p>The Apps are offered only to individuals who possess the legal capacity to enter into these Terms or whose legal guardian has agreed to these Terms. You hereby agree that you possess the legal authority to enter into these Terms and to form a binding agreement under any applicable law, to use the App(s) in accordance with these Terms, and to fully perform your obligations hereunder. If you are under the age of majority, you agree that your legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms.</p>

<h2>2. The Apps</h2>
<p>We offer various mobile applications (such as educational, casual and hyper casual games) for all ages (“<strong>Apps</strong>”): (i)  Apps distributed within our developer account under the brand “Studietto” or "Marco Bellinaso" that do not include an age-gate and are intended for general audiences (“<strong>Studietto Apps</strong>”). (ii)  Apps that do include an age-gate and are treated as primarily directed at children (“<strong>Children Apps</strong>”). (iii)  Apps that include an age-gate and are not primarily directed at children but may appeal to them. Users of such Apps who indicate they are under the age of sixteen (16) are treated as children.</p>

<p>Note that the Apps may include local notifications that are sent to a User directly on his/her mobile device.<br /> Certain Apps may permit in-app purchases, even if such Apps were downloaded for free. Such in-app purchases may not require the re-entry of credit card information as such in-app purchases will be made through an existing account with a third party distributor (such as Apple or Google ). Please note that the Apps may only be available for certain operating systems (such as iOS or Android). The User may only download and use the Apps on a device running validly licensed copies of the operating systems on which the Apps were designed to operate. To be able to access and/or use the Apps, or any portion thereof, User must legally obtain all the applicable or required facilities, utilities, software and equipment at his/her sole risk and expense.</p>

<p>We may make some Apps available to you at no charge and others for a fee (whether by way of in-app purchases or subscription), as described on our Apps detail pages. If such requested fees are not paid, it may result in the User not being able to access the Apps or parts thereof.</p>

<p><u>With respect to Apps that provide an option to pay periodic subscription fees</u>: such payment will enable the User to receive access to the full version of the App (i.e., unlimited access to the full functionality of such App) and any related content updates. The User will be able to enjoy such full version of the App from any devices registered on his/her app store account, as long as his/her subscription is active. A User may cancel a subscription, however, the cancellation will not come into effect until the end of the applicable billing cycle. If the User ceases to pay the subscription fees, the User will return to the &#8220;free to play&#8221;/free trial mode, which is limited in the functionalities that are provided for free (if any). The duration, price and terms of payment of the subscriptions will appear in the applicable Apps detail pages.</p>

<p><u>Auto-renewal subscriptions</u>: By signing up for a subscription, you agree that your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each paid subscription, unless you cancel it, and you authorize us to charge your account for the renewal term. The auto-renewal may be turned off by the User in his/her app store account settings following the first payment of the subscription fees. Deleting the App from the device does not necessarily result in cancellation of your subscription. For more information how to manage subscriptions please refer to Apple Support at: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039">https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039</a> or Google Support at: <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1689236">https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=1689236</a>. The download pages of auto-renewal subscription Apps will indicate the subscription&#8217;s duration, price and terms of payment. The following conditions apply with respect to auto-renewal subscription:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payments will be charged to User&#8217;s app store account at confirmation of purchase;</li>
<li>The subscription will automatically renew, unless the User turns off the auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current cycle (on iTunes), or chooses to cancel such subscription before the end of the current cycle (Google Play);</li>
<li>User&#8217;s AppStore account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period;</li>
<li>Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the User purchases a subscription to that App, where applicable; and we may increase pricing for Users who are existing subscribers:

<ul>
<li>In the case of the AppStore, the Users will be asked to agree to the new price, otherwise the auto-renewal feature will be disabled.</li>
<li>In the case of Google Play, a notice will be sent to the User and the increase will apply to the next payment due from the User after the notice, provided that the User has been given at least 10 days&#8217; prior notice before the charge is made. If the User is given less than 10 days&#8217; prior notice, the price increase will not apply until the payment after the next payment due.</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Note: </u>We may, at our discretion, distribute Promotional Codes (defined below) which allow free use of Apps (or portions thereof). We may also make some Apps available to Users for offline use. During the offline use not all functionalities will be available to the Users. In addition, you hereby acknowledge and agree that you may be charged for Internet and data usage charges made through use of the Apps according to the applicable rates charged by your respective third party internet and data usage service provider.
